# Java_Cinema

A cinema management GUI (graphical user interface) application written in Java/JavaFX with data persistence maintained using XML. 
Allows customer and employee sign up and navigation to different sides of the application based on role. Employees can add films, 
view data about bookings & seating plans and edit their own data. Customers can view a home page, view what's on, filter by date/genre, book for 
specific showings and maintain their account. 

For a demonstration of the application, see the following video:

### Getting executable JAR file

To get an executable JAR file for this project follow the instructions here: https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs307/handouts/Eclipse%20Help/jarInEclipse.htm
When running program from the JAR file: to add images to the application - store images in a folder called 'images' at the root
